# C++ Lab work
This repository contains important labs for 3 different classes that taught C++. It does not include all assignments or smaller code projects from the classes, but most of the concepts are encapsulated within these projects.

## ✨🧬[game-of-life-final](./game-of-life-final/)  
This project is a game of life implementation with screen wrap written for my Advanced C++ class at Colorado State University.

## ✨🌳[avl-tree-redo](./avl-tree-redo/)  
A later attempt at creating an AVL tree.

## 🔏[cipher-maker](./cipher-maker/)  
Contains two algorithms for taking input text and encrypting it, block cypher & stream cypher.

## 🧬[game-of-life](./game-of-life/)  
My first attempt at creating the 'game of life', had a few bugs and did not give exactly expected results.

## 🌳[binary-search-tree](./binary-search-tree/)  
An implementation of a binary search tree.

## 🌳[avl-trees](./avl-trees/)  
First attempt at creating an AVL tree.

## 📍[coordinates](./coordinates/)  
My first project using C++, I remember this project being so hard at the time. Looking back on it now this code looks so small.
